# TMUX Config

There are some interesting features here. First, I decided to break out some parts of the
configuration into their own files, namely color schemes and plugins.

Of course, this is a work in progress, as I've only been using TMUX for a few days.

If you want to use this config,

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:jcmuller/my-tmux-config.git /path/to/repos/tmux
$ ln -s /path/to/repos/tmux/tmux ~/.tmux
$ ln -s /path/to/repos/tmux/tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf
```
